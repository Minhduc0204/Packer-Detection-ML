# Packer-Detection-ML
This is my final thesis at USTH.
The prject goal is to find the best ML model to detect packer for Malware Analysis. After that, i will make a software or maybe website to execute the model.
The main dataset of the project is taken from https://github.com/packing-box/dataset-packed-pe. I already fork it in my work.
Modules used: pip install scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm pandas pefile matplotlib joblib numpy
